Being able to fully leverage the data you have means you can control all activities that occurred across all Defender's workloads. 
However, starting from scratch can be challenging for some, and sample queries may not always suffice. 
Therefore, in this repository on KQL-XDR-Hunting, I will be sharing 'out-of-the-box' KQL queries based on feedback, security blogs, and new cyber attacks to assist you in your threat hunting.
